<p>This website lists my personal projects and homework to keep everything organized. </p>


<h2>MS Computer Science</h2>
<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
<p>These repositories are my portion of a team project.  The project was a mobile Student ID.  After logging in to the mobile app there was a sinngle button where a student could request a QR code to pay for a meal on their meal plan.  The application contacted the server and received a response that was turned into a QR Code to scan for a meal.  BIME stands for the first initials of each person on the team.</p>
<p>I developed the mobile app functionality, one of the other students worked on the UI, his commit is included in the repo.  Two other students developed the Web Server and Database which are not included here.</p>
<h4>BIME_Android</h4>  
<p>This is part of the actual project that was demonstrated, all but one commit is my work.  This application is using the zxing library for generating QR codes and Volley for managing HTTP requests.</p>

<h4>BIME_Server</h4>
<P>This repository was designed to test the Android app, while the actual project server was being developed.  The students working on the server were having trouble deploying to GCP, and eventually deployed to Azure.</p>
<p>I wrote the test server to develop the app against.  It uses the Spring library and was developed using TDD. I deployed this server to the GCP.</P>
<p>This server does not do real work, but returns success or failure depending on the inputs, this allowed testing the mobile app pefore the actual server was developed.  Once the other students deployed their server this project was updated to match.   </p>
