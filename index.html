<p>This website lists my personal projects and homework to keep everything organized. </p>


<h2>MS Computer Science</h2>
<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
<p>These repositories are my portion of a team project.  The project was a mobile Student ID.  There was a mobile application that contacted a server to login in.  It had one feature where a student could request a QR code to pay for a meal on their meal plan.</p>
<h4>BIME_Android</h4>  
<p>This is part of the actual project that was demonstrated, all but one commit is my work.  </p>

<h4>BIME_Server</h4>
<P>This repository was designed to test the Android app.  The students working on the server were having trouble deploying to GCP.  I wrote the test server to develop the app against.  It uses the Spring library and was developed using TDD. I deployed it to the GCP as a demonstration, but they went with a Azure.</P>
